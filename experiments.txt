Setting:
    - looping road (like a circle)
    - fixed number of cars
    - same type of cars
    - different types of drivers

- Why cross lane?
    - to bypass a traffic jam / accident
        cross from a jammed lane to an empty lane, drive pass the jam, and cross back

- What logic should self-driving car follow?
    take into account 5 cars in the front and 4 cars at the back
    Control speed so that 11 cars run at constant speed and high average speed.

    - maybe always maintain the same speed as the car in front?

- Will self-driving car help? How many percentage is needed?

- total stopping distance = perception-reaction distance + braking distance.
