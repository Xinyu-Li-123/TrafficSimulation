- Theoretical and Numerical analysis of traffic snake on a ring
    Under which density will the snake shrink / stay / grow?
    - Possible idea
      Draw the graph of n-v 
        where n is car number (nth car has velocity v_n)

- [Experiment] Using the unsmoothed optimal velocity function will result in a smaller equibrium velocity. Why?

- self-driving vehicle / smarter velocity with more input
    How to modify the velocity function to fight against the traffic snake?
